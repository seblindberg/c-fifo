# FIFO

A simple fifo buffer implementation designed primarily for embedded targets. To keep the memory footprint small the buffer size is limited to powers of two.

## Usage

```c
/* Allocate the fifo data structure and a buffer. The size
   must be a power of two and in the range [4, 256]. */
fifo_t  fifo;
uint8_t buffer[64];

fifo__ctor(&fifo, buffer, 64);

/* Write to the fifo.
   This function returns the number of bytes it managed to
   write. */
fifo__write(&fifo, "Hello World", 11);

fifo__used(&fifo);      // => 11
fifo__available(&fifo); // => 53

/* Read from the fifo.
   This function returns the number of bytes that were
   successfully read from the buffer. */
char dest[11];
fifo__read(&fifo, dest, 11);
```

## Installation

Simply running `make` will build the static library file `libfifo.a` and place it in the `lib` directory. Run `make test` to compile and run the tests found in the `tests` directory. `make clean` will remove all output generated by the build system.
